/**
 * Adapter for CDI environments.
 * <p>
 * The CDI container provides injectable instances of DM-UPnP UPnP interfaces, e.g.
 * you can <code>@Inject Registry</code> or <code>@Inject ControlPoint</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, this adapter also binds DM-UPnP into the CDI eventing system. You
 * can <code>@Observe RemoteDeviceDiscoveryStart</code> etc. events of the
 * registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Even better, in the future you might be able to listen to GENA UPnP events with
 * the same API - although this will require some magic for subscription...
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * TODO: This is a work in progress.
